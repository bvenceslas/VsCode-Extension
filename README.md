# VsCode Extensions

**Visual Studio Code** is a text editor which was developed by Microsoft Corporation in order to run in both *Windows, Linux, and macOS*. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control and GitHub, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
